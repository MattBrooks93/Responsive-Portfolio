			<p>Matt Brooks is a web developer from Athens Georgia. He has had an interest in web design 
			since taking his first web design class in high school, and his passion has only grown.
			After beginning the Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech, he realized that he had been putting off
			the inevitable for far too long, and that he was destined to make the web a more enjoyable place
			to explore.</p>
